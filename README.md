2f.1) My website is to show what I am doing with my life. I will be showing why I learned some instruments and Why I love traveling. I've always been interested in traveling because I want to see the world. I have always wanted to go to Scotland and Germany. I want to explore and be places that I have never been to before. I started playing the violin 6 years ago. I first saw Lindsey Stirling playing the violin and I thought that she looked super graceful while playing and I wanted to be like her. What I didn't know at the time was how much effort it really was to play the violin.

2f.2) What I want to do with my life
  I want to travel, play music and play games professionally.
  Scotland and Germany are the two places that I want to visit most.
  I play the violin, guitar, ukulele, some piano, some cello and some flute.
  I play a lot of games on the xbox and some games on pc. 

2g) I will use the RWD principals to make sure that my website is adaptible to phones, tablets, and computers. I will have all of the content of my website either in plain sight or in a menu button. If it is in a menu button I will need to make sure that everything works properly. 

2h) Some ways that I could make my website more accessible would be to have a colour contrast between text and background.I will choose a color that stands out against the background but I won't make the page to bright either. I will use descriptive links. These will help anyone if they are visually impaired. 

3a) My website goals will be to show people what I want to do when I'm older and what I do now. The purpose statement- I have always loved traveling and playing music. I go to camp almost every summer because I don't like being stuck at home all of the time. I love the mountains and all the things I get to see when I go to camp. As for music, I can't get enough of it. It gets hard for me to focus without music but I have to deal with it. I have been learning different instruments over the years and it can be difficult to rememeber everything but there are ways to memorize most of it.

3b) My target audience will be family and friends. They will want my website to run smoothly and to be able to get around my website without problems. 

3c) The pages that I want to use will be the home page, a page for each of the things that I will talk about, different pages for the different topics, and maybe extra pages for those.

3d) I will add pictures to my website to show what I do. All of the pictures were taken by me other then the pictures of the games. I will get the pictures of the game off of the game's websites. I will say who made the games and a little description of the games as well.

3e) My website structure will be Hierarchical. When some one is on the home page, they can go to any of the topics that I want to talk about. When they are on one of those pages they can go to one of the other topics or they can go to a page with more details about that topic. They can click on the logo of my website when they want to go back to the home page.
